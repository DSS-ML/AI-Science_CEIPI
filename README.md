# 🤖 AI, Transformers, and the Acceleration of Science

> **Module 2:** M2 AIDTIP (Artificial Intelligence, Digital Technologies & Intellectual Property)  
> **Date:** November 20, 2025  
> **Location:** CEIPI / Online

Welcome! This repository contains the lecture materials and code examples for the session on how Artificial Intelligence—specifically Transformer architectures—is reshaping scientific discovery and economic frameworks.

The goal of this module is to bridge the gap between technical innovation (Transformers, Attention Mechanisms) and their application in "Rugged Knowledge Landscapes".

## 📂 Repository Contents

### 1. 📊 Lecture Slides
* **[Download PDF Slides](./LectureSlide.pdf)**
    * *Key Topics:* From RNNs to Transformers, The "Cost of Prediction", AlphaFold & Scientific Discovery, and the Economic Co-evolution of Skills.

### 2. 💻 Hands-on Demo (Python)
The provided notebook explores three different paradigms of using Large Language Models (LLMs) in research, addressing **Accessibility**, **Privacy**, and **Scale**.

| Part | Tool | Goal | Key Concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Hugging Face** 🤗 | Quick, specific tasks (Summarization) | *Transfer Learning* & *Accessibility* |
| **2** | **Ollama** 🦙 | Local, private execution (Gemma) | *Data Privacy* & *System Prompts* |
| **3** | **Cerebras** ⚡ | Instant inference on Frontier Models (Llama 70B+) | *Wafer-Scale Hardware* & *Parallelization* |

## 🧠 Discussion Points
During the lecture, we use these demos to discuss the following paradoxes:

1.  **The "Black Box" Dilemma** *We saw Cerebras answer in milliseconds. In traditional science, validation takes months. Are we evolving from creators of knowledge into mere "verifiers" of machine outputs?*

2.  **Creativity vs. Hallucination** *By adjusting parameters like `Temperature` and `Top_P`, we move from a deterministic scientific tool to a creative storyteller. Where do we draw the line in research?*

3.  **The Accessibility Paradox** *Can open-source models running on a standard laptop (Ollama) really compete with industry giants? Or is the "Democratization of AI" dependent on hardware access?*
